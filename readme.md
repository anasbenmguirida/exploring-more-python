# 🐍 Python Learning Playground

Welcome to my personal Python learning repository! 🚀  
This is where I share small projects, exercises, and experiments as I grow my skills in Python and eventually dive into the world of **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)**.

## 📘 About

This repo is my digital notebook for:

- Practicing core Python concepts (lists, dictionaries, loops, etc.)
- Solving fun coding challenges and mini-projects
- Building up toward real ML/DL projects

I believe in learning by doing — and this repo reflects my journey from beginner to building intelligent systems. 💡
